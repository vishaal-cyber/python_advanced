## 11. Testing and Validation

### Self-Testing with Client Application

You will receive a Flask client application (`client_app/`) that you can use to test your API implementation:

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Create virtual environment for API server**:
   ```bash
   cd api_server
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment for client application**:
   ```bash
   cd client_app
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Testing Workflow

1. **Start your API server** (in API server virtual environment):
   ```bash
   cd api_server
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Start the client application** (in client virtual environment):
   ```bash
   cd client_app
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Test all features**:
   * Add and view books
   * Add and view members
   * Checkout and return books
   * View borrowed books and member details
   * Test validation and error handling

### API Testing Tools

You can also test your API using:

* **FastAPI Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
* **Postman**: Import API endpoints for testing
* **curl**: Command-line API testing
* **Python requests**: Script-based testing

### Validation Checklist

Before submission, ensure:

* [ ] All endpoints respond correctly
* [ ] Data validation works (ISBN, email, etc.)
* [ ] Business rules are enforced
* [ ] Error handling is proper
* [ ] Client application works with your API
* [ ] API documentation is accessible

Good luck with your implementation!
